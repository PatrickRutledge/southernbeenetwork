# 🐝 BeeNetwork: Civic Directory for the Beekeeping Community

## 🧾 Purpose

BeeNetwork is a community-first platform for local beekeepers, suppliers, educators, and advocates. Built on resilient Azure infrastructure, it promotes verified listings, shared knowledge, regional events, and symbolic civic participation.

No trial phase. No friction. Just a principled system for public memory, community outreach, and sustainable infrastructure.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Highlights

- **SQL Database**: `BeeNetworkDB` with Transparent Data Encryption, SQL Ledger, and immutability via Digest Storage
- **Static Web App**: Civic interface for directory, events, and resources
- **Azure Function**: Handles listing submissions and civic data intake
- **Security**: CMK-backed encryption, selective IP access, digest verification
- **Symbolic Tagging**: Encoded across resources for stewardship, region, phase, and access model
